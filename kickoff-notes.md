# RFK Community Outreach Kickoff
_Compiled by Lizzie Ellis, June 26th, 2019_

These notes were compile at the Code for DC project night that Councilmember Charles Allen attended in June 2019. The event was the kickoff for this project, and consisted mainly of a Q & A with the Councilmember. The conversation has been broken out into 3 sections below: straight Q & A (all A's are paraphrases of the CM's responses), preliminary brainstorm for the site, and thoughts on how we engage "the community", and what that community is.

## Q & A with Charles Allen

* 2 main avenues for DC to acquire this land:
    * Park service
    * Sale through Congress with conditions (i.e. memoral site). Legislation right now to facilitate the sale
    * Q: Is there danger there's going to be a rider attached to the sale that a stadium has to come with?
        * A: Congresswoman Norton has said she won't approve the sale with a stadium on the land, 



* Q: has there been other outreach done so far around this? 
    * A: Events DC has been leading the process so far. The mission of the group is essentially to be the DC sports/entertainment commission. The group has designed some plans to date, but if they're left to be in charge the land will likely be sports use in some way. 

* Q: Assuming we get a ton of feedback, how will that impact the decision making process?
    * A: Some of it will be political by nature of the process -- the Council and the mayor will likely fight about it no matter what's out there. But building a narrative around the policies is important and this feedback will help that

* Q: Generally it's unlikely that anyone will go for a plan that's all afforble housing and greenspace, so how will that change the narrative we build as a result?
    * A: Goal is to get some really clear principles out of this tool. Consensus is rare in these kinds of projects, but likely there'll be kind of overarching narative
    
* Q: are there similar projects that you think might be a good model to look at?
    * A: The Wharf has good & bad things, revived waterfront but doesn't have any kind of family-style housing. Needs to have 3 bedrooms as well as 1-bedrooms. Currently in Ward 6, the value of a 3br home is becoming totally unreachable for most. As far as process, can't think of any 

* Q: What issues are your constituents concerned about overall (outside of this project) right now?
    * A: Transit access/affordibility/equity, Aging in Place, Schools/Education, Housing affordibility across the board. 

* Q: What's the timeline on this project?
    * A: Try and have something by the fall when school starts up and football season starts again :football:

* Q: Do you see any other sites in the city that might go through a similar process in the future? 
    * A: Thsi project could lay the groundwork for looking at future other big parcels (i.e. Poplar Point) that might come to the city at some point. 
    
* Q: How can we as technologists help?
    * A: We've been able to get a fair number of people through hailnorfk.com, but we want to capture more voices. This is city wide, and we want to capture something beyond "we don't want a stadium."

* Q: What's the end product from this project?
    * A: Whatever the outcome, it should give policymakers a clear sense of a true(r) representation of what people want. Anything visual would be incredibly helpful, and visual matters. A map would be ideal that could be displayed? "Nothing is as powerful as a picture". Beyond that, a list of top priorities/principles, or a written description of what they're thinking could also be useful.  


## Website Brainstorm/Scope
**CM Allen:** Having a site that people can interact with will be engaging and will hopefully lead to a strong argument about why the project should look a specific way.
* Survey w/ priorities? 
* Prompt questions? 
* "Sim City" -- engaging, can move things around. 

One Idea --
* Part 1: Draw what you want
* Part 2: These are the outputs
    * Q: How valuable is part 2 compared to part 1?
        * A: People would want to know that decision X creates Y thousand jobs, but it won't actually impact the finances and the final decision of what to build. Cost of the construction/subsidies will determine that much more. 

* What else did you like about the [GGW Redistricting tool?](https://ggwash.org/view/8776/now-you-too-can-redraw-dcs-wards)
    * A: Took an "insider politics" thing and made it way more accessible to the general public. Similarly, DC Office of Planning created the [SW Small Area Plan](https://planning.dc.gov/publication/southwest-neighborhood-plan) where they had community meetings and had planners design based on what they heard. 
    * Other answers: part of the joy was that you could print out Your Map and share it or hang it on your fridge or whatever.

Color-coded shading by usage type?
Draw a line and have the map calculate...something? about that zone (cost, usage, jobs?)

One thought -- two important outputs: :one: Show involvement (this many people from this many wards provided input) to back up results and :two: maps/pictures/renderings -- important but maybe a different requirement beyond the constitutent piece
* Use IP addresses to verify identity? Need to figure out a way to validate who these people actually are.
    * Make it as easy as possible to contribute  (registration pages reduce likelihood of signup)
    * Possible 3rd output: build civic capacity to make sure that there's a sense of ownership on (in this case) the land

Game called "City Skylines" that's so good people use it for civic 
* Community visioning event where that game is running on several laptops, and then present what people build at that event on a website?
* Neighborhood hackathon for constituents with multiple laptops?  

MVP: survey/free text fields? Bubble fields with high-level ideas? Heat maps?

Is realism important -- should it be more narrative or more actionable? 
* example: email addresses on trees were supposed to be for park feedback but people started writing love letters

Goal is to try and build a "competitive/alternative" vision to Events DC. 

#### Engaging Community: What is "community"? How do we reach as many voices as possible?
* At the same time, want to be careful that we're not getting overwhelmed by outside non-local superfan groups that tip the vote
    * CM ALlen: would want to keep it city-specific but not limited to Ward 6
