Notes from Daniel:
-He noted that the American Institute of Architects actually has an in-person game/exercise that is very simliar to what we are building. They have done it with ANC reps as a training. He can put us in touch with them if we are interested in trying to play it to give us a sense of what we can build into the tool.

-We brainstormed a couple small technical questions: 
Assuming we're doing a grid - how big should each square be. 50 sq ft?
What to do about streets? Idea to just extend the street grid across the site and people just fill in each block. If you pick stadium, that can sit on top of the grid.

His vote on what to include/exclude: Generally speaking his opinion was stay focused on the core things. If something is unlikely to be selected by people and/or is not really a part of the community conversation right now, not as necessary to account for it.
-Mixed-Income Housing (Yes)
Low-density
Mid-density
High-density
Affordable-Only Housing (Recommended No b/c the financing dynamics are so radically different).
Retail (Yes)
Hotel (Maybe)
Office (Maybe)
Industrial (No)
New Metro (Yes, but make it a fixed location and a single yes/no toggle)
Hospital (Maybe)
Football Stadium (Yes)
Other Entertainment Venues (No)
Parks and Rec (Yes)
Schools (Recommended no b/c the dynamics of this are much different and hard to say what the cost would be, but might have to be if people expect)

*Outputs*
We talked about focusing on 4 outputs that would update in realtime as users updated their map:

1. Housing Units Created - (Nice to show this against some kind of goal if we can politically swing it "That's X% of the citywide/area/site target!"

2. Affordable Housing Units Created (Same)

3. Square Feet of Retail Created (as you reach certain sizes, you "unlock" different types of things like grocery)

4. Public Dollars Spent/Earned - Basically this would be a sum of both the revenue-generating (basically money the city gets from selling the land (residual land value), which increases as you put more and higher density development) and the revenue-costing factors (pretty much everything else -- parks, schools, parking, etc)

Guess we could also add square feet of parks/recreational facilities

Things we brought up that he recommended against:
Ongoing long-term costs/benefits (ie tax revenue from new residents)
Rental Prices
Environmental Impact
Impervious Surface Charges/Impact



More details on each of these line items:

*Housing*:
The recommendation here was to simplify a bit. Rather than create affordable and market as distinct choices, just put them together because in reality the way the city will address this is through mixed dev anyway. And all affordable requires starting to calculate sources of funding like low-income tax credits, ongoing subsidies, etc. 
So when you pick housing (of any density level) you could then adjust the slider on what % affordable you want, but there would be a ceiling (have to double confirm what number that would be).

To calc the number of units created we just take the Floor-Area-Ratio of each zone (something equivalent to the low, medium, high density), multiply that by the sq. ft selected and we can divide by 850 (average sq feet of a new unit in a building but we could make that adjustable). 

Obviously if we want to allow people to put bigger single family homes we would make that number bigger.


*Retail*
Opening question: do we need the tool to limit you to retail you have created demand for - or should we just let you add whatever. If we do, we can start with some inherent demand from the surrounding area (X), and then you unlock an additional 1k sq ft for every 200 units of housing you create
In terms of choices, we can make it simple. You can either add single story retail on it's own, or you can toggle to add ground floor of retail to any of your housing. Doing the latter can also increase the residual land value ($ to the city) of the housing project.

*Hotel/Office*
Keep it simple - it adds a residual land value bonus of 25% (compared to what housing on the same block would do) but obviously produces no housing. Limit office max to 500,000sq ft. Maybe cap hotels at 2.

*Parking*
we can peg at 7k per space (will need to determine how many spaces fit per sq ft).

*New Metro*
Likely costs 150 - 200 million. But we like the idea of adding it providing you a land-value bonus to the immediate surrounding area. So if you put housing/office/hotel next to it, you see your "money gained" bar go up even more.

*Everything Else* 
Basically anything that's not the above 3 costs some amount of money. We will need to connect with a few other folks to get good prices for library/school/park/rec center/etc.



*Relationships*
Important political question about how the tool works: does your plan need to pay for itself? Ie are you blocked from adding a park until you've made the money for it with the dev. Or should it just show that if you don't add enough, you're going to have to draw $X from the city budget which will necessitate cuts to other areas or increased taxes.

While blocking things until you make the money feels maybe too thumb on the scale, I do think we want people to gamify "how much can I squeeze in here without going below 0" so maybe it's just about strong feedback loops and gentle pushes. (letting you pick some other priorities to fund with your surplus for instance? like expanding the housing protection trust fund, giving city employees a raise, etc. etc.)


*Next Steps*

1. Turn my long narrative here into the handful of key decision points - particularly as the affect scope. Come to consensus on those

2. For things we decide to include, make a small spreadsheet with cells for us to put the key numeric variables we need to find. $ cost per sq ft and each of the outputs per square foot I would assume.

3. Review if there are things not included here that we really think are essential, and we can sketch out who to talk to to figure those out.

4. Maybe we schedule this game with the AIA folks when I'm back from vacay
