## Purpose

Build a tool in collaboration with the office of DC Councilmember Charles Allen to collect public feedback and opinion on land usage at the former RFK stadium site in Ward 7 of the District.


## Background

The RFK stadium site is located in Ward 7 and consists of approximately 170 acres. The redevelopment area is currently owned by the National Park Service, and is leased to D.C. until 2038. The current lease limits the land use to stadium and public outdoor activities.  Legislation has been introduced to transfer the land to the government of D.C., which would allow for more development options.

We want to hear what D.C. residents envision for the site.

What type of tool would most effectively engage D.C. residents to share their opinions on how the site should be redeveloped?


## Defining the Project

</b>What:</b> Collect public feedback and opinion on land usage at the former RFK stadium site in Ward 7 of the District.

<b>Who:</b> All residents of D.C.!

<b>When:</b> Timeline TBD

<b>How:</b> What is the best way to gather public opinions in a manner that is accessible for all residents of D.C.?

## What should the tool be?
1. Map first: Create a map a la Sim City where people can draw what the want to be built on the site. Should there be preset objects, or can residents draw anything? There should be stats such as percentage of total land being used by type or purpose. Another option is to have residents draw or describe loosely, and have content creators build out the designs. Can residents vote for their favorite maps and plans?
2. Slider first
3. Slider only
4. Open-ended opinions
5. Pick top 3 categories for development: Provide a list of development options, and residents will pick the top 3.
6. A survey: Most low-tech option, survey monkey, walk around the neighborhood and ask people, interview high schoolers nearby etc.
